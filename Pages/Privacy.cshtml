        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>PetVibes collects data from users' uploaded images of their pets.</p>

        <p>The primary purpose of collecting image data is to analyze and interpret the emotions of the pets using machine learning algorithms. This analysis aims to provide insights into the emotional states of pets.</p>

Once the analysis is completed, the resulting emotional states are stored in our database for further use, such as generating daily and monthly reports for users.</p>

        <p>Users have full control and ownership over the image data collected from their live streams. They can access, modify, or delete their data at any time through their user accounts on the PetVibes platform.</p>
